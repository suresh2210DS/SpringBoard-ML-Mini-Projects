# This mini-project is based on the K-Means exercise from 'R in Action'

# Exercise 0: Install these packages if you don't have them already

# Exercise 1: Remove the first column from the data and scale
# it using the scale() function

# Now we'd like to cluster the data using K-Means. 
# How do we decide how many clusters to use if you don't know that already?
# We'll try two methods.

# Method 1: A plot of the total within-groups sums of squares against the 
# number of clusters in a K-means solution can be helpful. A bend in the 
# graph can suggest the appropriate number of clusters.

# Exercise 2:
#   * How many clusters does this method suggest?
#   * Why does this method work? What's the intuition behind it?
#   * Look at the code for wssplot() and figure out how it works

# Suresh - 3 clusters. No rapid decrease after 3. 


# Method 2: Use the NbClust library, which runs many experiments
# and gives a distribution of potential number of clusters.

# Exercise 3: How many clusters does this method suggest?

# suresh - # 3 ( three)
# Exercise 4: Once you've picked the number of clusters, run k-means 
# using this number of clusters. Output the result of calling kmeans()
# into a variable fit.km

# Now we want to evaluate how well this clustering does.

# Exercise 5: using the table() function, show how the clusters in fit.km$clusters
# compares to the actual wine types in wine$Type. Would you consider this a good
# clustering?
